# hello-world
I'm a father of four boys who loves the ocean, the mountains and music. I've spent the last tweleve years working for two "big 4" public accounting firms, specializing in public company audit, compliance and attestation. I'm super excited for the chance to work with GitHub because I think they have the best mix of culture, organizational strategy and backing and product.
